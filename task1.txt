JSColorPicker is a nice open source project for a color picker component. We have forked the project and now want
to add a new feature that will allow the user to define a gradient. We want to add a new configuration property called
allowGradientSelection and default it to false. But when allowGradientSelection is to true then when the color picker
dialog opens we will have two 'tabs' or panels where the user can select 'Solid Color' or 'Gradient'. When the user is on
the 'Solid Color' mode the component operates just like it does today.

On the Gradient mode we will have some extra controls. Instead of selecting a single color there will be a way to choose
between a start color and end color. The existing color picker controls will be used to set the start and end color. They can highlight
those colors swatches to switch between the start and end color.

The only other new UI would be an 'Angle' selection that appears on the gradient mode. It will have a slider and a number input that 
allows the user to put in numbers from 0 to 360.

We will want to create a demo/test for this in the dev/index.html page. Let's break this down into tasks and create a tasks.md file
where we can check items off when they are completed. But we want to tackle this in small pieces so we can review and adjust.
